# How to Put (Almost) Anything in a Browser
Welcome to **How to Put (Almost) Anything in a Browser** at the MIT Media Lab's Festival of Learning (Spring 2023). This repository is a template you can use to get your own project started.

## Tech Stack

The main technologies used in this repository are:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript-based library for building user interfaces.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A framework for building server-rendered React applications with automatic code splitting and optimized performance. We use this for added flexibility.
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/): A UI framework for React that provides a set of high-quality and well-documented components for building web applications.
