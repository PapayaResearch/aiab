abstract = "Accessing large, manually annotated audio databases in an effort to create robust models for emotion recognition is a notably difficult task, handicapped by the annotation cost and label ambiguities. On the contrary, there are plenty of publicly available datasets for emotion recognition which are based on facial expressivity due to the prevailing role of computer vision in deep learning research, nowadays. Thereby, in the current work, we performed a study on cross-modal transfer knowledge between audio and facial modalities within the emotional context. More concretely, we investigated whether facial information from videos could be used to boost the awareness and the prediction tracking of emotions in audio signals. Our approach was based on a simple hypothesis: that the emotional state’s content of a person’s oral expression correlates with the corresponding facial expressions. Research in the domain of cognitive psychology was affirmative to our hypothesis and suggests that visual information related to emotions fused with the auditory signal is used from humans in a cross-modal integration schema to better understand emotions. In this regard, a method called dacssGAN (which stands for Domain Adaptation Conditional Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Networks) is introduced in this work, in an effort to bridge these two inherently different domains. Given as input the source domain (visual data) and some conditional information that is based on inductive conformal prediction, the proposed architecture generates data distributions that are as close as possible to the target domain (audio data). Through experimentation, it is shown that classification performance of an expanded dataset using real audio enhanced with generated samples produced using dacssGAN (50.29% and 48.65%) outperforms the one obtained merely using real audio samples (49.34% and 46.90%) for two publicly available audio–visual emotion datasets."

@article{Zhou2014,
abstract = {Scene recognition is one of the hallmark tasks of computer vision, allowing definition of a context for object recognition. Whereas the tremendous recent progress in object recognition tasks is due to the availability of large datasets like ImageNet and the rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning high-level features, performance at scene recognition has not attained the same level of success. This may be because current deep features trained from ImageNet are not competitive enough for such tasks. Here, we introduce a new scene-centric database called Places with over 7 million labeled pictures of scenes. We propose new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets and show that Places is as dense as other scene datasets and has more diversity. Using CNN, we learn deep features for scene recognition tasks, and establish new state-of-the-art results on several scene-centric datasets. A visualization of the CNN layers' responses allows us to show differences in the internal representations of object-centric and scene-centric networks.},

@article{Schroeder1961,
abstract = {Electronic devices are widely used to introduce in sound signals an artificial reverberation subjectively similar to that caused by multiple reflections in a room. Attention is focused on those devices employing delay loops. Usually, these devices have a comb-like frequency response which adds an undesired “color” to the sound quality. Also, for a given reverberation time, the density of echoes is far below that encountered in a room, giving rise to a noticeable flutter effect in transient sounds. A class of all-pass filters is described which may be employed in cascade to obtain “colorless” reverberation with high echo density.

abstract = {Although 360° cameras ease the capture of panoramic footage, it remains challenging to add realistic 360° audio that blends into the captured scene and is synchronized with the camera motion. We present a method for adding scene-aware spatial audio to 360° videos in typical indoor scenes, using only a conventional mono-channel microphone and a speaker. We observe that the late reverberation of a room's impulse response is usually diffuse spatially and directionally. Exploiting this fact, we propose a method that synthesizes the directional impulse response between any source and listening locations by combining a synthesized early reverberation part and a measured late reverberation tail. The early reverberation is simulated using a geometric acoustic simulation and then enhanced using a frequency modulation method to capture room resonances. The late reverberation is extracted from a recorded impulse response, with a carefully chosen time duration that separates out the late reverberation from the early reverberation. In our validations, we show that our synthesized spatial audio matches closely with recordings using ambisonic microphones. Lastly, we demonstrate the strength of our method in several applications.},
